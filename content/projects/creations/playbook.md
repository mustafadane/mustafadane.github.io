This is a project to be used internally at Fullstack Academy of Code. Main purpose is to create projects and tasks for incoming students in Asana and edit all of them at once. PostgreSQL database is used to keep the tasks and projects data. Node/Express server is used to communicate with database and Asana API. React and Blueprint.js are used in the front-end. Whole project is written in TypeScript!

* Worked with other software developers and supervised by campus
director, Ben Neiswander.
* Project aims to create a full-stack website for bulk creating and
updating projects with tasks for students at Fullstack Academy.
* My involvement was to create front-end with React, Node.js,
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
