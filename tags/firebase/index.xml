      <description>$PL/IT is a mobile tab splitting app for friends who go out to eat but have different spending habits. iOS and Android users can upload photos of their receipts and claim ownership of each item in that receipt. Once the event is closed, each user is shown how much they should pay or charge other users in the event.
Development This was built using Google&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Vision API with a front end in React Native and a back-end in Firebase.</description>
